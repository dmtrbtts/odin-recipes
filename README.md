# odin-recipes
This is my first project on The Odin Project platform, where I was improving my skills such as:

- Basic HTML tags (lists, links, images);
- Basic GIT commands (cloning, pushing, adding files to stage and commiting);
- Basic UNIX console commands (creating dirs and files, coping, moving and deleting);
