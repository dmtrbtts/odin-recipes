    <h1>Soft Serve Ice Cream</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Why is soft serve so appealing? When you make scooped ice cream, you have to plan a day in advance, spin it the next day, wait for it to 
        harden overnight, and then scoop it the next day, so it's really a three-day process. But soft serve offers the freedom to mix a few 
        ingredients together, put it into the machine, and taste it five minutes later. It's so gratifying! We can make changes on the fly and 
        are always experimenting in a fluid way</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound strawberries</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup light corn syrup</li>
        <li>1/3 cup water</li>
        <li>1/8 tsp xanthan gum (a natural stablizer that's easy to find at specialty supermarkets)</li>
        <li>1 cup coconut cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove the green tops from the strawberries and slice them into perfect slices.</li>
        <li>Toss the berries in sugar until they are completely coated and cook in a 350-degree oven until they are perfectly cooked, slightly caramelized, 
            and overwhelmingly aromatic, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the strawberries from the oven and allow to cool to room temp. Once the berries are cooled, puree them really well with a blender. 
            Pass the berries through a fine mesh strainer to get out most of the remaining pulp and seeds.</li>
        <li>Stir together about one fourth of the sugar with all of the xanthan gum in a small bowl. Pour the water in a small saucepan, add the sugar mixture 
            and immediately whisk vigorously until very smooth (don't fret over a few lumps).</li>
        <li>Stir in the corn syrup. Set the pan over medium heat and cook, stirring often and adjusting the heat if necessary to prevent a simmer, until the sugar 
            has fully dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and immediately whisk in the strained berry puree and the coconut cream.</li>
        <li>Transfer the soft serve base into an airtight container and refrigerate until well chilled, about four hours, or, for even better texture and flavor, 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Pour the soft serve base into a standard at-home ice cream maker and turn on the machine. Churn just until the mixture has the desired texture of soft serve, 
            about 15 to 25 minutes depending on the machine.</li>
        <li>Use a spatula to scoop all of the ice cream into a piping bag and pipe the ice cream out into a cone!</li>
        <li>This soft serve could be stored, covered, in the freezer for up to two weeks but should be very tediously tempered before eating after being frozen.</li>
    </ol>
